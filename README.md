Internet surveillance systems: Sentiment analysis of COVID-19 cases in Greece using Twitter data
## Extended description
Syndromic surveillance using Internet data has been used to track and forecast epidemics for the last two decades, using different sources, from social media to search engine records. More recently, studies have addressed how the World Wide Web could be used as a valuable source for analysing the reactions of the public to outbreaks and revealing emotions and sentiment impact from certain events, notably that of pandemics.
This code aims to evaluate the capability of Twitter messages (tweets) in estimating the sentiment impact of COVID-19 cases in Greece in real time as related to cases.
